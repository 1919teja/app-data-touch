# --- How to Use ---
# 1. Change the number_of_rows to how many data points you want (e.g., 1000, 2000).
# 2. Change the output_filename if you want a different name for your CSV file.
# 3. Run this Python script. It will create the CSV file in the same directory.

number_of_rows = 1000000  # <--- Set desired number of rows here
output_filename = 'custom_touch_data_1000.csv' # <--- Set desired filename here

generate_touch_data(number_of_rows, output_filename)

# Example for 2000 rows:
# number_of_rows_2k = 2000
# output_filename_2k = 'custom_touch_data_2000.csv'
# generate_touch_data(number_of_rows_2k, output_filename_2k)
